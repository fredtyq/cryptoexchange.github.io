                <Text style={styles.simpleText}>{`\u2022`} In case of sending virtual assets, the transaction rate and the amount to be paid are calculated after 2 (Bitcoin) or 4 (Ethereum) confirmations of the transaction in the network or after confirmation of a successful payment in the payment system. After the exchange rate is fixed, the amount to be paid is transferred manually to the details specified by the client. Payments are made to any hryvnia cards issued by Ukrainian banks.

As a rule, the system receives confirmation after payment instantly, but in some cases there may be delays on the part of the payment system or bank. Also, please note that the amount to be paid will be revised against the current exchange rate at the time of payment - which is fixed after the payment is received through our merchant.</Text>
                <Text style={styles.simpleTextHeader}>Payment sending errors:</Text>
                <Text style={styles.simpleText}>{`\u2022`} When sending a payment, the system may be refused, about which the client will be notified via email specified by client. For a number of possible reasons: - Failure of the payment system - one of the reasons, possible temporary technical work. - The client specified incorrect details - non-existent, incorrect, blocked account number. - Refusal to credit from the issuer's bank - a currency card is indicated or the limit for receiving funds has been exceeded.

                <Text style={styles.simpleTextHeader}>Rules for solving problem situations:</Text>
                <Text style={styles.simpleText}>{`\u2022`} All issues that arise are resolved through our Support Service.
